      title: 'Fire-Fighting Robot',
      mentor: 'N.B Totla',
      teamSize: 4,
      skills: ['3D Modeling', 'Fusion 360', 'Time Management', 'Testing'],
      description:
        'A compact fire-fighting robot designed to extinguish fires without human involvement, equipped with multiple functionalities. It was engineered to autonomously detect fire sources and navigate through hazardous areas. Additionally, we integrated a water spraying mechanism and tested the robotâ€™s ability to move in constrained environments, enhancing its real-world applicability.',
